# Admin Authentication

Authentication for the admin dashboard (`/admin/*`) is handled via server-side logic using environment variables and cookies.

## Core Logic

*   The authentication functions (`login`, `logout`, `isAuthenticated`, `requireAuth`) are defined in [lib/auth.ts](mdc:lib/auth.ts).
*   Login credentials (`ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`) are read from environment variables (likely defined in `.env.local`).

## Session Management

*   Upon successful login, a session cookie named `admin-session` is set using `cookies()` from `next/headers`.
*   This cookie is checked by `isAuthenticated` and `requireAuth` to protect admin routes.
*   The `logout` function removes this cookie.

## Important Notes

*   The functions in [lib/auth.ts](mdc:lib/auth.ts) are designed to be used in Server Actions or Route Handlers.
*   Recent changes required adding `async/await` to the `cookies()` calls due to potential Next.js version updates or type mismatches.
